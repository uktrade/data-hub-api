    Cursor pagination for activities.

    The activity stream service scrapes specified endpoints at regular intervals to get the
    activity feed from various services. It scrapes all the pages and more frequently: the
    last page only. If the last page has a "next" link, it scrapes that and updates the pointer
    to the last page.

    The default LIMIT-ORDER pagination gets slower as you progress through the pages so we
    decided to use cursor pagination here because we needed to render the last page quite
    frequently.

    The built-in Django Rest Framework Cursor pagination is not used, since it

    - has a lot of code that isn't applicable to this use case, which makes it tricky to extend or
      debug, e.g. for peformance issues
    - uses an almost-unique value + offset cursor that isn't needed when we have a completely
      unique compound cursor: (modified_on, id)
