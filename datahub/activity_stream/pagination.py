class ActivityCursorPagination(CursorPagination):

    Cursor pagination for activities.

    The activity stream service scrapes specified endpoints at regular intervals to get the
    activity feed from various services. It scrapes all the pages and more frequently: the
    last page only. If the last page has a "next" link, it scrapes that and updates the pointer
    to the last page.

    The default LIMIT-ORDER pagination gets slower as you progress through the pages so we
    decided to use cursor pagination here because we needed to render the last page quite
    frequently.

    According to the docs (See ref), cursor pagination required an ordering field that amongst
    other things:

        "Should be an unchanging value, such as a timestamp, slug, or other
        field that is only set once, on creation."
