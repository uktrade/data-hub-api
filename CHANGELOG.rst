Data Hub API 11.12.0 (2019-05-02)
=================================



Internal changes
----------------

- The ``update_company_registered_address`` Django command is now available for internal use. This copies the ``registered_address`` of all CompaniesHouseCompany records to the corresponding Company record with the same ``company_number``. If a CompaniesHouseCompany is not found, it resets the ``registered_address``.

API
---

- **Companies** New API endpoints were added to aid matching Data Hub companies with D&B companies:

  All endpoints return a response body with the following format::

      {
          "result": {
              ...
          },
          "candidates": [
              { ... },
              { ... }
          ],
          "company": {
              "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
              "name": 'My Corp',
              "trading_names": ["trading name"]
          }
      }

  The value of ``result`` depends on the type of match.

  If a match was found and recorded::

      {
          "dnb_match": {
              "duns_number": "111",
              'name': 'NAME OF A COMPANY',
              "country": {
                  "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
                  "name": "United States"
              },
              "global_ultimate_duns_number": "112",
              "global_ultimate_name": "NAME OF A GLOBAL COMPANY",
              "global_ultimate_country": {
                  "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
                  "name": "United States"
              },
          },
          "matched_by": "data-science"
      },

  If ``matched_by`` contains ``adviser`` value, then additional ``adviser`` key will be added to the ``result`` response::

      {
          ...
          "matched_by": "adviser",
          "adviser": {
              "id": "12777b9a-5d95-2241-a939-fa112be2d22a",
              "first_name": "John",
              "last_name": "Doe",
              "name": "John Doe"
          }
      },

  If a match wasn't found because the company isn't listed or the adviser is not confident to make the match::

      {
          "no_match": {
              "reason': "not_listed",  # or "not_confident"
          },
          "matched_by": "adviser",
          "adviser": { ... }
      },

  If a match wasn't found because there were multiple potential matches::

      {
          "no_match": {
              "reason": "more_than_one",
              "candidates": [  # list of duns numbers
                  "123456789",
                  "987654321"
              ]
          },
          "matched_by": "adviser",
          "adviser": { ... }
      },

  If a match wasn't found because of other reasons::

      {
          "no_match": {
              "reason": "other",
              "description": "explanation..."
          },
          "matched_by": "adviser",
          "adviser": { ... }
      },

  The top level ``candidates`` is a list of objects with this format::

      {
          "duns_number": 12345,
          "name": 'test name',
          "global_ultimate_duns_number": 12345,
          "global_ultimate_name": "test name global",
          "global_ultimate_country": {
              "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
              "name": "United States"
          },
          "address_1": "1st LTD street",
          "address_2": "",
          "address_town": "London",
          "address_postcode": "SW1A 1AA",
          "address_country": {
              "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
              "name": "United States"
          },
          "confidence": 10,
          "source": "cats"
      }

  Endpoints:

  ``GET /v4/dnb-match/<company_pk>`` returns the response above

  ``POST /v4/dnb-match/<company_pk>/select-match`` accepts the ``duns_number`` of the candidate to be selected as a match from the list of candidates

  ``POST /v4/dnb-match/<company_pk>/select-no-match`` accepts ``reason`` with value:

  - ``not_listed``: if none of the candidates is a good match
  - ``not_confident``: if the adviser is not confident to make the match
  - ``more_than_one``: if there are multiple potential matches. In this case an extra ``candidates`` field is required with the list of valid duns numbers.
  - ``other``: for other reasons. In this case an extra free text ``description`` field is required
- **Investment** The field ``actual_land_date`` is now required to move an investment project
  from active to verify win.


Data Hub API 11.11.0 (2019-04-30)
=================================

Deprecations and removals
-------------------------

- **Companies** On the 4th of May 2019, all data in the ``company_company`` registered address fields will be replaced by the official data from the Companies House record identified by the ``company_company.company_number`` field.
  In cases where ``company_company.company_number`` is invalid or blank (e.g. for non-UK companies), the registered address fields will be made blank and the related data lost.
  List of registered address fields:

  - ``registered_address_1``
  - ``registered_address_2``
  - ``registered_address_town``
  - ``registered_address_county``
  - ``registered_address_postcode``
  - ``registered_address_country_id``


Internal changes
----------------

- **Companies** The field ``company.Company.registered_address_country`` was made blankable so that it becomes optional in the Django admin.
- The ``company_field_with_copy_to_name_trigram`` search field type was removed and uses of it replaced with ``company_field``. The ``name.keyword``, ``name.trigram`` and ``trading_names.trigram`` sub-fields are now used in search queries. This change also means that the type of the ``name`` sub-field has been corrected from ``keyword`` to ``text``.
- Python was updated from version 3.7.2 to 3.7.3 in deployed environments.

Database schema
---------------

- **Companies** The following columns were made ``NOT NULL`` - optional values will be represented by empty strings:

  - ``company_company.registered_address_2``
  - ``company_company.registered_address_county``
  - ``company_company.registered_address_postcode``
  - ``company_company.address_1``
  - ``company_company.address_2``
  - ``company_company.address_town``
  - ``company_company.address_county``
  - ``company_company.address_postcode``
  - ``company_company.trading_address_1``
  - ``company_company.trading_address_2``
  - ``company_company.trading_address_town``
  - ``company_company.trading_address_county``
  - ``company_company.trading_address_postcode``

=================================



Deprecations and removals
-------------------------

- **Interactions** The deprecated ``interaction_interaction.contact_id`` column was deleted from the database. Please use the ``interaction_interaction_contacts`` many-to-many table instead.

Internal changes
----------------

- **Investment** The logic has been updated for selecting which financial year's data is used to calculate the GVA for an investment project.
- The ``name.keyword`` and ``name.trigram`` sub-fields of the ``contact_or_adviser_field`` field type are now used in search queries. Hence, the ``name_trigram`` sub-field of ``contact_or_adviser_field`` has been removed, and the type of the ``name`` sub-field has been changed from ``keyword`` to ``text``.

  will archive an interaction with the supplied reason.

  ``POST /v3/interaction/<uid>/unarchive`` This will 'un-archive' an interaction.

Database schema
---------------

  companies.

  A new column ``transfer_reason`` has been added to the ``company_company`` table. This indicates the reason that data
  about the company was transferred. The current possible values are an empty string, or ``'duplicate'``.
- **Investment** A new column ``exclude_from_investment_flow`` has been added to the ``metadata_investmentprojectstage`` table.

Data Hub API 6.2.0 (2018-08-23)
===============================



Deprecations and removals
-------------------------

- **Companies** The field ``account_manager`` has been deprecated. Please check the API and Database schema categories
  for more details.
- **Companies** The column ``company_company.parent_id`` has been deleted from the database.
- ``GET /whoami/`` endpoint: ``read_*`` permissions have been renamed to ``view_*``. This endpoint will return both ``view_*`` and ``read_*`` permissions for now but ``read_*`` permissions are deprecated and will soon be removed.

Features
--------

- **Companies** It's now possible to export the one list via the django admin from the company changelist.
- **Interactions** The CSV export of search results has been amended to return various additional columns.
- **Investment** It's now possible to export investment project search results as a CSV file (up to a maximum of 5000 results).
- The format of timestamps in CSV exports and reports was changed to YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS for better compatibility with
  Microsoft Excel.
- Document upload now uses V2 API of AV service.

Bug fixes
---------

- Document upload streaming to AV service now uses a StreamWrapper to encode the file as multipart/form-data in order to send it to AV service. This fixes the problem when the file has been sent incorrectly.

Internal changes
----------------

- Django was updated to version 2.1.

API
---

- **Companies** ``GET,POST /v3/company/<uuid:pk>`` and ``GET /v3/search/company``: the field

- **Interactions** ``GET /v3/interaction`` can now be sorted by ``dit_adviser__first_name``, ``dit_adviser__last_name``, and ``subject``.
- **Investment** ``POST /v3/search/investment_project/export`` was added for exporting investment project search
  results as a CSV file with up to 5000 rows. The ``investment.export_investmentproject``
  permission was also added and is required to use this endpoint.
- ``GET /whoami/`` endpoint: ``read_*`` permissions have been renamed to ``view_*``. This endpoint will return both ``view_*`` and ``read_*`` permissions for now but ``read_*`` permissions are deprecated and will soon be removed.

Database schema
---------------

- **Companies** The column ``company_company.account_manager_id`` has been deprecated and will be removed on or after August 30.
  Please use ``company_company.one_list_account_owner_id`` instead.
