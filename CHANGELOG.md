# Data Hub API 27.2.0 (2020-02-04)


## Features

- **Companies** A view was added to allow admin users to select company ID/duns number for D&B
  company linking. This forms the first step for the admin D&B link tool. As the
  tool is not yet complete, it is not linked to from elsewhere in the admin yet.

## API

- **Companies** The `GET /v4/company/<pk>` API endpoint was updated to make sure `export_countries` field is included in the response only when the user has `company.view_companyexportcountry` permission. And omits otherwise.

  The `PATCH /v4/company/<pk>/export-detail` API endpoint was updated to make sure requests from users with `company.change_companyexportcountry` permission are honoured.
- **Companies** A new endpoint, `GET /v4/company-referral` has been added. It lists referral sent or received by the adviser. 
  Refer to the API documentation for the schema.
- **Companies** A new endpoint, `GET /v4/company-referral/<id>`, was added. This retrieves a single referral object.


# Data Hub API 27.1.0 (2020-02-03)


## Internal changes

- **Companies** The `update_from_dnb` admin tool was refactored to break out some useful utilities
  for use by other modules.  This will aid in the new "Link Company with D&B" tool
  which will follow shortly.
- Some data retention and `dbmaintenance` queries were updated to filter on `Exists()` subqueries directly (rather than via an annotation) following the update to Django 3.0.
- Django was updated from version 2.2.9 to 3.0.3.

## API

- **Companies** A new endpoint `PATCH /v4/company/<pk>/export-detail` was added to allow export related details of a company to be edited, including adding export countries into the new `CompanyExportCountry` model, moving from old company export country fields: `export_to_countries` and `future_interest_countries`.

  If feature flag is OFF, API will work as is updating old fields. And if the feature flag is ON, API will start updating new model instead. In both scenarios, data will be synced across to allow feature flag to be switched ON and OFF when required.


# Data Hub API 27.0.0 (2020-01-29)


## Removals

- **Advisers** `GET /adviser/`: The deprecated `first_name`, `first_name__icontains`, `last_name`, `last_name__icontains`, `email` and `email__icontains` query parameters were removed.

## Features

- **Companies** A utility function `datahub.dnb_api.link_company.link_company_with_dnb` was added which
  provides a mechanism for linking a Data Hub company record with a D&B company
  record. The utility function saves the pertinent D&B data to the Data Hub record.

  This will allow us to firstly provide an admin mechanism for quickly linking
  companies, followed by an API endpoint.
- **Companies** The following criteria were added to the `automatic-company-archive` Celery task:

  - Do not have any ongoing investment projects
  - Do not have any investor profiles

## API

- **Advisers** `GET /adviser/`: The deprecated `first_name`, `first_name__icontains`, `last_name`, `last_name__icontains`, `email` and `email__icontains` query parameters were removed.
- **Companies** A new endpoint, `POST /v4/company-referral`, was added. This creates a new company referral. Refer to the API documentation for the schema.


# Data Hub API 26.6.0 (2020-01-28)


## Features

- **Companies** The `format_dnb_company` now includes a check for `annual_sales_currency`.

  If `annual_sales_currency` is not US Dollars, we do not propagate `annual_sales` or `is_annual_sales_estimated` fields downstream.

  All D&B records that we have encountered until now have `annual_sales` in US dollars but we would like to monitor this behavior and not ingest bad data in case there is an exception.
- **Companies** Added a `datahub.dbmaintenance` command `get_dnb_one_list_tier_companies.py` which
  enables querying of DNB-matched One List Tier B companies. This was re-instated
  after removal in a previous commit to enable further rollout of DNB hierarchies
  to Data Hub company records.

## Database schema

- **Companies** A new `company_referral_companyreferral` table was added to hold referrals of companies between DIT advisers.

  The table has the following columns:

  - `"id" uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY`
  - `"created_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
  - `"modified_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
  - `"status" varchar(255) NOT NULL`
  - `"completed_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
  - `"subject" varchar(255) NOT NULL`
  - `"notes" text NOT NULL`
  - `"company_id" uuid NOT NULL`
  - `"completed_by_id" uuid NULL`
  - `"contact_id" uuid NULL`
  - `"created_by_id" uuid NULL`
  - `"modified_by_id" uuid NULL`
  - `"recipient_id" uuid NOT NULL`


# Data Hub API 26.5.0 (2020-01-27)


## Features

- **Companies** The company list view in Django admin now has a filter for `dnb_modified_on` field.

  This allows us to e.g. filter companies that were updated during today.
- Endpoints are now sorted by path in the API docs.

## Internal changes

- Swagger UI, used in the API docs, was updated to version 3.25.0.

## API

- **Companies** `GET /v4/dataset/companies-dataset`: 2 new fields were added to the companies dataset response:
  - `global_headquarters_id`
  - `global_ultimate_duns_number`
- **Companies** `GET /v4/company/<pk>`: Expose export countries as `export_countries` from new `CompanyExportCountry` model within company response. The field has following structure:

   ```json
  {
      "export_countries": [
          {
          "country": {
              "name": ...,
              "id": ...
          },
          "status": "currently_exporting"
          },
          {
          "country": {
              "name": ...,
              "id": ...
          },
          "status": "not_interested"
          },
          {
          "country": {
              "name": ...,
              "id": ...
          },
          "status": "future_interest"
          },
      ]
  }
  ```
- **Interactions** `GET /v4/dataset/interactions-dataset`: The field `modified_on` was added to the interactions dataset endpoint.


# Data Hub API 26.4.0 (2020-01-20)


## Features

- **Companies** A new Celery task called `automatic_company_archive` was added to Data Hub API.

  This task would run every Saturday at 8pm in *simulation mode* with an upper limit of a *1000 companies*. In simulation mode, this task would log the IDs of the companies that would have been automatically archived using the following criteria:

  - Do not have any OMIS orders
  - Do not have any interactions during the last 8 years
  - Not matched to any D&B records
  - Not created or modified during the last 3 months

## Bug fixes

- The `delete_orphaned_versions` command was modified to select records to be deleted in a fashion that is more 
  efficient in the environment it will run.

## API

- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: The behaviour of the `uk_postcode` filter was modified so that spaces are ignored only if a full postcode is searched for.

  This means that `AB11` and `AB1 1` are now distinct searches (where the former would match e.g. `AB11 1AA` and the latter would match e.g. `AB1 1AA`). (Previously, both searches were equivalent and matched both postcodes.)
- **Interactions** Interactions API `/v3/interaction`, `export_countries` tagged to an interaction are consolidated into `CompanyExportCountry` model, in order to maintain company export countries list. If a country added to an interaction doesn't already exist in company export countries, it will be added. If in case that country already exists, following business rules apply:

  * `Status` of `InteractionExportCountry` added to an interaction with current date overrides the entry within `CompanyExportCountry` with older date.
  * Whereas `Status` of `InteractionExportCountry` added to an interaction with past date can't override the entry within `CompanyExportCountry` with newer date.
  * An interaction added with future date, will be treated as current date and existing rules apply.

## Database schema

- **Companies** A new model `company_companyexportcountryhistory` was created to log all changes made to `company_companyexportcountry` model. This will maintain all inserts, updates and deletions to that model with appropriate `history_type` with values `insert`, `update` and `delete`.


# Data Hub API 26.3.0 (2020-01-15)


## Removals

- The IP restriction functionality provided by `django-admin-ip-restrictor` was removed as it was not in use as we're using private networking and other mechanisms within GOV.UK PaaS instead.

## Features

- It is now possible to perform queries to search endpoints in the API browser.

## Internal changes

- **Investment** The squashed `investor_profile` migration `0001_squashed` was transitioned to a normal migration and the migrations it replaced were removed.

## API

- **Investment** `GET /v4/dataset/investment-projects-dataset`: 5 comma joined string fields were changed to return arrays of strings:
  - `actual_uk_region_names`
  - `business_activity_names`
  - `delivery_partner_names`
  - `strategic_driver_names`
  - `uk_region_location_names`


# Data Hub API 26.2.0 (2020-01-14)


## Internal changes

- `Elasticsearch`: The new `postcode_analyzer` and `postcode_search_analyzer` analyzers were added. Analyzers can be used 
  to enable partial search for area, district, sub-district, sector and a whole postcode. 

  The search is case insensitive and any spaces are filtered out before analysis.
- Uses of the deprecated Django function aliases `force_text()` and `urlquote()` were replaced with `force_str()` and `urllib.parse.quote()`.

## API

- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: A `uk_postcode` filter was added for the `address_postcode` and `registered_address_postcode` 
  fields for UK based companies. The filter accepts a single or a partial postcode as well as an array of postcodes. 
  Multiple postcodes are matched with `or` query.
- **Interactions** `GET /v4/dataset/interactions-dataset`: 3 new fields were added to the interactions dataset response:
  - `policy_area_names`
  - `policy_feedback_notes`
  - `policy_issue_type_names`
- **Interactions** Interactions API `/v3/interaction` now allows to specify if there was a discussion of countries during the interaction and add one or more export countries along with their status.

  `were_countries_discussed` is a nullable boolean field.

  `export_countries` field is of type `InteractionExportCountry` and takes a list of `country` and `status` combinations where `country` is of type `Country` and `status` is a choice of `Not interested`, `Currently exporting to` or `Future country of interest`.

  * Above details are only valid for non-investment themed interactions. Hence `were_countries_discussed` is mandatory field for both `export` and `other` themed interactions.
  * At least one country/status combination is mandatory if `were_countries_discussed` is set to True


# Data Hub API 26.1.0 (2020-01-09)


## API

- **Advisers** `GET /v4/company-list/<pk>/item`: The latest interaction of each list item now includes an array of DIT participants in the `dit_participants` field. In context, the field has the following structure:

  ```json
  {
      "results": [
          {
              "latest_interaction": {
                  "dit_participants": [
                      {
                         "adviser": {
                             "id": ...,
                             "name": ...
                         },
                         "team": {
                             "id": ...,
                             "name": ...
                         }
                      },
                      ...
                  ]
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```


# Data Hub API 26.0.0 (2020-01-08)


## Removals

- The following deprecated endpoints have been removed from Data Hub API:

  - `GET v4/dnb-match/<uuid:company_pk>`
  - `POST v4/dnb-match/<uuid:company_pk>/select-match`

- The following deprecated tables have been removed from Data Hub API:

  - dnb_match_dnbmatchingcsvrecord
  - dnb_match_dnbmatchingresult

## Features

- **Companies** The `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates` task now run with a specific list of fields to update by default.

  This was introduced to not update `domain` & `registered_address` fields. This is because the data for these fields does not meet Data Hub standards. D&B have been informed of this and are working on a fix.

- Python was updated from version 3.7.5 to 3.8.1. This includes updating various indirect dependencies.

## Internal changes

- The following internal query utilities were added:

  - `get_array_agg_subquery()`
  - `JSONBBuildObject`

## API

- **Investment** `GET /v4/dataset/investment-projects-dataset`: The `allow_blank_possible_uk_regions` field was removed and replaced with `uk_region_location_names`.


# Data Hub API 25.0.0 (2020-01-02)


## Removals

- **Companies** The feature flag that enabled the new add-a-company journey was removed.

  This makes the new add-a-company journey the default way to add a new company in Data Hub.
- **Companies** The `get_dnb_one_list_tier_companies` management command was removed from Data Hub.

  This command was put in temporarily to safely run queries required for DNB company hierarchies rollout.

## Deprecations

- The following `dnb-match` endpoints will be deprecated on or after 5 January 2020:

  - `GET v4/dnb-match/<uuid:company_pk>`
  - `POST v4/dnb-match/<uuid:company_pk>/select-match`
  - `POST v4/dnb-match/<uuid:company_pk>/select-no-match`
- The following tables will be removed from Data Hub on or after 5 Jan 2020:

  - `dnb_match_dnbmatchingcsvrecord`
  - `dnb_match_dnbmatchingresult`


# Data Hub API 24.5.0 (2019-12-23)


## Features

- **Companies** Added integration tests for the `rollback_dnb_company_updates` management command.
  This can now be used as it has been fully tested.
- **Companies** A management command `rollback_dnb_company_updates` was added to revert updates applied
  by either the `update_company_dnb_data` command or the `get_company_updates` task. 
  At present, the rollback command calls a stub function which will be fleshed out later -
  it is not ready for use.

## Bug fixes

- **Companies** A bugfix was made to ensure that the task id for the overall company updates
  process is used as an update descriptor in reversion comments.  This will allow the use
  of a rollback tool in the event that D&B updates need to be undone.


# Data Hub API 24.4.0 (2019-12-20)


## Features

- **Companies** A new management command, `update_company_uk_region`, was added.

  This can update the UK regions of companies using a CSV file stored in Amazon S3.
- **Companies** A new management command, `update_company_sector`, was added.

  This can update the sectors of companies using a CSV file stored in Amazon S3.


# Data Hub API 24.3.0 (2019-12-19)


## Features

- **Companies** The `update_company_dnb_data` command was adjusted so that an audit log is fired
  to sentry after a successful run.


# Data Hub API 24.2.1 (2019-12-18)


## Bug fixes

- **Companies** A bug was fixed that resulted in a runtime error in the `get_company_updates` celery task.

  The error happened when `get_company_updates` tried to wait on the results of sub-tasks in order to produce an audit log.


# Data Hub API 24.2.0 (2019-12-17)


## Features

- **Companies** A schedule was added for a nightly run of the celery task: `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates`.

  This task will ingest D&B updates from `dnb_service`. The number of updates applied in a single run will be controlled by the environment variable called `DNB_AUTOMATIC_UPDATE_LIMIT`.


# Data Hub API 24.1.0 (2019-12-17)


## Features

- **Companies** Companies updated with the `update_company_from_dnb` command and the 
  `update_companies_from_dnb_service` task are now saved with a reversion version
  which has a meaningful identifier in the comment. This identifier will help provide
  the groundwork for an "undo tool" which will allow us to reverse these automatic
  updates in the event of a problem.
- The CSRF token is now being added to API Docs request header. It is now possible to try POST requests.

## Internal changes

- **Companies** We are now recording `future_interest_countries` 
  and `export_to_countries` with both the `Company` model and the new model `CompanyExportCountry` 
  which we're currently integrating.

  - `investor_profile_investorprofile_investment_types`
  - `investor_profile_investorprofile_other_countries_being_cons84de`
  - `investor_profile_investorprofile_restrictions`
  - `investor_profile_investorprofile_time_horizons`
  - `investor_profile_investorprofile_uk_region_locations`
  - `investor_profile_investorprofile`
  - `investor_profile_profiletype`

## Features

- **Companies** A setting `DNB_AUTOMATIC_UPDATE_LIMIT` was added which can be used to limit the
  number of companies updated by the `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates`
  task.
- **Companies** Info log messages and a sentry-based audit log were added to the DNB company
  updates tasks to help provide better visibility for task runs.
- **Companies** A feature flag was added `"dnb-company-updates"` which governs whether or not to
  run the logic within the `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates` celery task.
  This affords us the ability to easily switch on/off DNB company updates as needed 
  during the rollout of this feature.

## Bug fixes

- **Companies** A bug was fixed to ensure that DNB company updates can be ingested over multiple
  pages from dnb-service.  Previously, the cursor value was not being extracted
  from the URL for the next page correctly.

## Internal changes

- **Companies** Integration tests were added for the `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates` task.
  These were not added as part of the original development as the task and it's dependent
  task (`datahub.dnb_api.tasks.update_company_from_dnb_data`) were developed in parallel.

  Additionally, the calls that `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.get_company_updates` makes to
  `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.update_company_from_dnb_data` were fixed to be the correct
  signature.
- Python was updated from version 3.7.4 to 3.7.5 in deployed environments.

## Database schema

- **Interactions** A new table `interaction_interactionexportcountry` was created.
  It has foreign key fields `interaction_id` and `country_id`
  with status, value is expressed as:
  * 'currently exporting to'
  * 'future interest'
  * 'not interested'


# Data Hub API 23.2.0 (2019-12-02)


## Features

- **Companies** A celery task was added which takes a dictionary of company data sourced from
  dnb-service and updates the company record corresponding to it in Data Hub.
- A celery task called `get_company_updates` was added.

  This task gets all the available company updates from the dnb-service and spawns downstream tasks to apply these updates to D&B matched company records in Data Hub.
- The views that will replace stock Django Admin method of authentication with Staff SSO were added.

## Bug fixes

- **Companies** Merging two companies (via the admin site) now works when both companies are on the same company list.

## Internal changes

- **Companies** A celery task `datahub.dnb_api.tasks.sync_company_from_dnb` was added which gives
  a mechanism for syncing specified fields for a DNB-matched company with the latest
  DNB data for that company.


# Data Hub API 18.0.0 (2019-11-08)


## Removals

- **Advisers** The `company_list_companylistitem` column `adviser_id` will be removed in the next release.
- **Advisers** The following legacy company list endpoints were removed:

    - `GET /v4/user/company-list`
    - `GET /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
    - `PUT /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
    - `DELETE /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
- **Companies** The Companies House admin view is no longer available in Data Hub.
- **Companies** The `sync_ch` Django command is no longer available in Data Hub.

  This command was used to sync Companies House data to Data Hub. We have now moved to D&B as the source for company data.

## Deprecations

- **Advisers** A `company_list_companylist` field `"is_legacy_default" boolean NOT NULL` will be removed on or after 20th November.
- **Companies** The following table will be removed from Data Hub on or after 12 November 2019:

  - `company_companieshousecompany`
- **Companies** The following Company endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on or after 12 November 2019:

  - `POST /v4/company`

  DataHub has moved to using D&B creating new companies and so instead of the above endpoint, please use:

  - `POST /v4/dnb/company-create`
- **Investment** The `GET /v3/investment/from` endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on or after 13 November 2019.

  (This was used by the old FDI dashboard which has now been decommissioned.)
- The `GET /dashboard/homepage/` endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on or after 13 November 2019.

  (This was used for the Data Hub home page before the My companies feature.)

## Bug fixes

- **Companies** The `POST /v4/company/<ID>/self-assign-account-manager` and `POST /v4/company/<ID>/remove-account-manager` endpoints now correctly update the `modified_by` field of the company (instead of leaving it unchanged).

## Internal changes

- **Companies** A helper function for the "Update from DNB" admin feature was refactored as
  a utility function `datahub.dnb_api.utils.update_company_from_dnb`.  The function
  can optionally take an iterable of fields to update so that we can partially
  update companies from DNB.
- **Interactions** The squashed migration `0001_squashed_0068_remove_interaction_location_from_database` was transitioned to a normal migration and the migrations it replaced were removed.
- Elasticsearch mapping type migrations are now automatically run during deployments.

## API

- **Companies** `GET /v4/dataset/companies-future-interest-countries-dataset`: An API endpoint for a dataset of future interest countries was added for consumption by data-flow and data-workspace.
- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: A filter was added for the `latest_interaction_date` field, in the form of `latest_interaction_date_before` and `latest_interaction_date_after`. Both the fields are optional. A company will only be returned if its latest interaction date falls between those dates.
- **Contacts** `GET /v4/dataset/contacts-dataset`: The primary contact flag and contact address details were added to the contacts dataset response
- **Events** A new events dataset endpoint (`GET /v4/dataset/events-dataset`) was added to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace.
- **Investment** The following endpoint was added:
  - `GET /v4/dataset/investment-projects-dataset`: Present agreed partially denormalized data of all investment projects to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace for reporting and analyst access.


# Data Hub API 17.1.0 (2019-10-30)


## Deprecations

- **Advisers** The following legacy company list endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 6 November 2019:

  - `GET /v4/user/company-list`
  - `GET /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
  - `PUT /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
  - `DELETE /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`

  Please use the new multi-list endpoints starting with `/v4/company-list` instead.
- **Companies** The following Comapnies House endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 6 November 2019:

  - `GET /v4/ch-company`
  - `GET /v4/ch-company/<company_number>`
- **Companies** The following Comapnies House endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 6 November 2019:

  - `GET /v3/search/companieshousecompany`
  - `GET /v4/search/companieshousecompany`

## Features

- **Companies** The `update-from-dnb` admin tool now shows changes to `global_ultimate_duns_number` field in the "review changes" table.
- **Investment** The proposition documents feature is now always active and is no longer behind a feature flag. (This feature was introduced in September 2018.)

## Internal changes

- **Interactions** Database migrations up to 0068 were squashed in order to reduce build times. The old migrations will be removed once the squashed migration has been applied to all environments.
- A correction was made to the deleted object collector (used to delete objects from Elasticsearch in bulk) to make it safe to use in web processes. This change has no current effect as the collector has only been used in management commands to date.
- The speed of search tests was improved by using more efficient test set-up. The reduction in running time of the search tests is approximately 65%.
- Various indirect dependencies were updated.

## API

- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: new filter `one_list_group_global_account_manager` was added.
- **Companies** `GET /v4/dataset/companies-dataset`: The field `address_country__name` was added to the companies dataset endpoint
- **Companies** A new endpoint, `POST /v4/company/<ID>/remove-account-manager`, was added. 

  The endpoint removes the assigned tier and account manager for a One List company on tier 'Tier D - Interaction Trade Adviser Accounts'.

  If the company is on a One List tier other than 'Tier D - Interaction Trade Adviser Accounts', the operation is not allowed.

  The `company.change_company` and `company.change_regional_account_manager` permissions are required to use this endpoint.


# Data Hub API 17.0.0 (2019-10-24)


## Features

- **Companies** A new dbmaintenance Django command was added to import data from csv format, with three fields `datahub_company_id`, `is_published_find_a_supplier` and `has_find_a_supplier_profile` provided by Data Science platform, into Data Hub company model's field, `great_profile_status`.

## Bug fixes

- **Companies** The dbmaintenance command `update_company_export_potential` is fixed to disable search signal receivers for company, to avoid queuing huge number of Celery tasks for syncing companies to Elasticsearch.

## Internal changes

- **Companies** A property `is_global_ultimate` was added to the `Company` model - this exposes
  whether or not a company is the global ultimate.

## API

- **Advisers** A new dataset endpoint (`GET /v4/dataset/advisers-dataset`) was added to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace.
- **Advisers** A new teams dataset endpoint (`GET /v4/dataset/teams-dataset`) was added to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace.
- **Companies** The property `is_global_ultimate` (a boolean) was added as a field to the following company API
  endpoints as a read-only field:

  - `GET /v4/company`
  - `POST /v4/company` - returned in the result
  - `GET /v4/company/<pk>`
  - `POST /v4/dnb/company-create`
- **Companies** The field `global_ultimate_duns_number` was added to the `DNBCompanySerializer`.

  This means that the `global_ultimate_duns_number` returned in the D&B responses will now be saved
  to the `global_ultimate_duns_number` field on the `Company` model.
- **Companies** A new endpoint, `POST /v4/company/<ID>/self-assign-account-manager`, was added. It:

  - sets the authenticated user as the One List account manager
  - sets the One List tier of the company to 'Tier D - Interaction Trade Adviser Accounts'

  The operation is not allowed if:

  - the company is a subsidiary of a One List company (on any tier)
  - the company is already a One List company on a different tier (i.e. not 'Tier D - Interaction Trade Adviser Accounts')

  The `company.change_company` and `company.change_regional_account_manager` permissions are required to use this endpoint.
- **Companies** A filter was added to the company collection API to allow callers to filter by
  `global_ultimate_duns_number` - e.g. `GET /v4/company?global_ultimate_duns_number=123456789`.
- **Companies** The field `global_ultimate_duns_number` was added to the response of the following company API
   endpoints:

  - `GET /v4/company`
  - `GET /v4/company/<pk>`
  - `POST /v4/dnb/company-create`
- **Contacts** `GET /v4/dataset/contacts-dataset`: Company and contact id fields were added to the contacts dataset endpoint 
  `GET /v4/dataset/contacts-dataset`: Superfluous company detail fields were removed from the contacts dataset endpoint
- **Interactions** `GET /v4/dataset/interactions-dataset`: Interaction id was added to the interaction dataset endpoint
- **OMIS** `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: Join between order and company was removed from the omis dataset endpoint
  `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: Join between order and contact was removed from the omis dataset endpoint
  `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: Order id, company id and contact id were added to the omis dataset endpoint
  `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: Team name was replaced with team id on the omis dataset endpoint

## Database schema

- **Companies** The `company_company` table now contains `global_ultimate_duns_number` field. This field will be populated by the `duns_number` for the global ultimate of a company. This data is included in the D&B payload.


# Data Hub API 16.0.0 (2019-10-21)


## Removals

- The legacy `GET /metadata/*` endpoints were removed. Please use Hawk authenticated `GET /v4/metadata/*` endpoints instead.

## Features

- **Companies** A new dbmaintenance Django command was added to import data from csv format, with two fields `datahub_company_id` and `export_propensity` provided by Data Science platform, into Data Hub comapany model.

## Bug fixes

- Unset cursor pagination `offset_cutoff` on dataset endpoints to fix issue when duplicate `created_on` dates are encountered.

## API

- **Companies** The `GET /company/<uuid:pk>` endpoint's read-only field `one_list_group_global_account_manager` now includes the account manager's contact email address under the `contact_email` field.
- **Companies** `GET /v4/company/<id>`: A new read-only field was added to company model `great_profile_status`. Values for this field are imported from Data Science platform, as a separate exercise. It can have one of the constant values out of `published`, `unpublished` and `null`.
- **Companies** Each adviser object returned by `/v4/company/<uuid:pk>/one-list-group-core-team` endpoint now includes a contact email address under the `contact_email` field.

## Database schema

- **Companies** A nullable `great_profile_status` varchar(255) column was added to the company_company table with possible values 'published', 'unpublished' and NULL.


# Data Hub API 15.9.0 (2019-10-17)


## Internal changes

- **Interactions** Various search model fields that were not being used in search queries (i.e. searched, filtered or sorted) are no longer indexed. This improves indexing performance.


# Data Hub API 15.8.0 (2019-10-14)


## Features

- **Companies** A new permission, `change_regional_account_manager`, was added. This permission currently has no effect and will be used as part of upcoming functionality.

  In the test data, this permission is assigned to teams with the `International Trade Team` role.
- **Companies** A tool was added to django admin to allow administrators to pull fresh data from DNB for a company with a `duns_number`.

  This allows administrators to resolve the unhappy-path for the new add-a-company journey by adding a `duns_number` to a company record followed by pulling data from DNB for the given company.

## Internal changes

- Migrations for the `mi` database are now applied automatically during deployments.


# Data Hub API 15.7.0 (2019-10-11)


## Features

- **Investment** The rounding of `gross value added` now always rounds up rather than using bankers' rounding where it would round to the nearest even number.

## Internal changes

- The IP check that is being used with Hawk authenticated endpoints was enhanced with additional rules to allow traffic 
  originating from an internal network.


# Data Hub API 15.6.0 (2019-10-10)


## Features

- **Companies** A new One List tier was added:
 
  | ID | Name |
  | --- | --- |
  | `1929c808-99b4-4abf-a891-45f2e187b410` | Tier D - International Trade Adviser Accounts |

  This tier currently contains no companies; it will be used as part of upcoming functionality.
- **Companies** Various superfluous unused One List tiers were manually removed from all environments.
- **Companies** All One List tiers were renamed:

  | Old name | New name |
  | --- | --- |
  | Tier A - Strategic Account | Tier A - SRM Programme Accounts |
  | Tier A2 - Global Partners | Tier A - SRM Commercial Partner Accounts |
  | Tier B - Global Accounts | Tier B - Sector Team Accounts |
  | Tier B - Global Accounts (Capital Investment) | Tier B - Capital Investment Team Accounts |
  | Tier C - Local Accounts (UKTI Managed) | Tier C - Investment Services Team Accounts |
  | Tier D - POST Identified/Managed | Tier D - Overseas Post Accounts |
  | Tier D - LEP Managed Branch (not IST) | Tier D - Local Enterprise Partnership Accounts |

## API

- **Interactions** `GET /v4/dataset/interactions-dataset`: Added interactions dataset endpoint to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace.


# Data Hub API 15.5.0 (2019-10-08)


## Features

- **Companies** New fields for `Countries exported to` and `Countries of interest` have been added to the csv file resulting from document download.

## API

- **Companies** `GET /v4/dataset/companies-dataset`: Added companies dataset endpoint to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace.
- **Companies** `GET /v4/company/<id>`: A new read-only field was added to company model `export_potential`. Values for this field are imported from Data Science platform, as a seperate exercise. It can have one of the constant values out of `very_higb`, `high`, `medium`, `low`,`very_low` and `null`.
- The `POST /v4/dnb/company-create` API endpoint will now save `registered_address_*`
  fields on Data Hub companies that it creates. Registered address fields will not be
  saved at all unless a minimum of `line_1`, `town` and `country` fields are provided.


# Data Hub API 15.4.0 (2019-10-03)


## Internal changes

- **Companies** Some intermittently failing company autocomplete tests were corrected so that they now consistently pass.

## API

- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: A filter was added for the `export_to_countries` field. This accepts a list of country IDs. A company will only be returned if it contains one of the specified countries in this field.
- **Companies** `POST /v4/search/company`: A filter was added for the `future_interest_countries` field. This accepts a list of country IDs. A company will only be returned if it contains one of the specified countries in this field.


# Data Hub API 15.3.0 (2019-10-01)


## Features

- **Companies** A tool was added to django admin to allow administrators to "unarchive" archived
  companies.
- A configurable blacklist was added so that we can specifically prohibit certain
  email addresses from the email ingestion feature.
- Email ingestion was adjusted so that emails are deleted after they are ingested.
  Previously, email ingestion would mark the emails as "seen" but now that we are
  out of the pilot for meeting invite ingestion we have switched to deletes as this
  is safer for data retention/protection reasons.
- The email ingestion whitelist was removed so that email ingestion is open to
  all DIT advisers.  
  The email domain that a DIT adviser uses to send an email to Data Hub must be 
  known to Data Hub through a `DIT_EMAIL_DOMAIN_<domain>` django setting -
  there is no longer a default domain authentication value. This ensures that 
  email ingestion is locked down to domains that we know the authentication
  signature for.


# Data Hub API 15.2.0 (2019-09-26)

## Removals

  - **Interactions** The `location` column was removed from the `interaction_interaction` DB table.

## Bug fixes

  - Fixed a bug in the DNB company save API endpoint which prevented DNB companies with no value for <span class="title-ref">domain</span> being saved as Data Hub companies.

## Internal changes

  - **Contacts** Dataset app is split up into subpackages. i.e. datahub.dataset.views to datahub.dataset.contact.views

  - **OMIS** Dataset app is split up into subpackages. i.e. datahub.dataset.views to datahub.dataset.order.views

  - The PaaS IP checks have been removed from Hawk authorisation code. A separate authentication class to check the IP has been implemented instead.
    
    The PaaS IP check can now be disabled using `DISABLE_PAAS_IP_CHECK` environment variable.

## Database schema

  - **Companies** Composite index (created\_on, id) is defined on Contact model for the sake of API endpoints defined under dataset app.
  - **Interactions** The `location` column was removed from the `interaction_interaction` table.

# Data Hub API 15.1.0 (2019-09-19)

## Removals

  - **Interactions** The `location` field for interactions was removed following its deprecation period. Please see the API and DB sections for further detail.

## Features

  - **Companies** A feature was added to notify a configurable list of recipients when a company is added to Data Hub which has the `pending_dnb_investigation` flag set. The intention is for this to be used to send investigation details to DNB directly; though notifications will be monitored with a DIT email address to begin with.

## API

  - **Companies** Two metdata API endpoints were added for One List Tiers. `GET /metadata/one-list-tier/` and `GET /v4/metadata/one-list-tier` list all One List Tier models in the following format:
    
        [
            {
                "id": "b91bf800-8d53-e311-aef3-441ea13961e2",
                "name": "Tier A - Strategic Account",
                "disabled_on": null
            },
            ...,
        ]

  - **Interactions** The `location` field was removed from the `GET /v3/interaction` and `GET /v3/interaction/<uuid:pk>` API endpoints.

  -   - **OMIS** The following API endpoint is updated
        
          - `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: The sector\_\_segment field was removed and sector\_name was added which is a string of multiple sector names separated by ",".

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** The `location` field was removed from the django state for the `Interaction` model.

# Data Hub API 15.0.0 (2019-09-17)

  - **Interactions** The field `location` is deprecated. Please check the API and Database schema categories for more details.

## Features

  - **OMIS** The notification logic in `datahub.omis` was adjusted to optionally use the `datahub.notification` app for triggering GOVUK notifications. This functionality can be switched on using a feature flag.

## Bug fixes

  - **Investment** The spellings of `Leisure` and `Commercial` in the Asset Class Interest metadata for Investor Profiles were fixed.

## API

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
      - `GET /v4/company-list/<id>`: Gets details of a single company list belonging to the authenticated user.
    
    Responses are in the following format:
    
        {
          "id": "string",
          "name": "string",
          "item_count": integer,
          "created_on": "ISO timestamp"
        }

  - **Companies** `GET /v4/company/<id>>/timeline`: This deprecated endpoint was removed. Please use `/v4/activity-feed` instead.

  - **Interactions** `GET,PATCH /v3/interaction/<uuid:pk>` and `GET,POST /v3/interaction`: the field `location` is deprecated and will be removed on or after 19 September.

  - **Interactions** The `/v3/search/interaction` endpoint was modified to return `company_one_list_group_tier` in search results. This will be in the following format:
    
        ...
        "company_one_list_group_tier": {
            "id": "b91bf800-8d53-e311-aef3-441ea13961e2",
            "name": "Tier A - Strategic Account"
        }
        ...
    
    The value could alternatively be null (if the interaction's company does not have a one list group tier).
    
    A filter was added to `/v3/search/interaction` - `company_one_list_group_tier` -which allows callers to filter interaction searches to companies attributed to a particular one list group tier.

  - A field `iso_alpha2_code` was added to the `GET /metadata/country/` API endpoint.
    
    This endpoint now returns results of the following format:
    
        ...
        {
            "id": "80756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
            "name": "United Kingdom",
            "disabled_on": null,
            "overseas_region": null,
            "iso_alpha2_code": "GB"
        },
        {

            "name": "United States",
            "disabled_on": null,
            "overseas_region": {
                "name": "North America",
                "id": "fdfbbc8d-0e8a-479a-b10f-4979d582ff87"
            },
            "iso_alpha2_code": "US"
        },
        ...

## Database schema

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** The `metadata_service.name` column was removed from the database.

## Internal changes

  - The `sync_es` management command was updated to use Celery.
    
    By default, the Celery task runs asynchronously. `--foreground` can be passed to run the Celery task synchronously (without Celery running).
    
    The `--batch_size` argument was removed as it is rarely used and isn't currently supported by the Celery task.

## API

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `PUT /v4/company-list/<company list ID>/item/<company ID>`
    
    This adds a company to the user's own selected list of companies.
    
    If the operation is successful, a 204 status code will be returned. If there is no company list with specified company list ID or company with the specified company ID, a 404 will be returned.
    
    If an archived company is specified, a 400 status code will be returned and response body will contain:
    
        {
            "non_field_errors": "An archived company can't be added to a company list."
        }
    
    Otherwise, the response body will be empty.

  - **Advisers** `GET /v4/company-list`, `PATCH /v4/company-list/<id>`: An `item_count` field was added to response items containing the count of items in the list.

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `GET /v4/company-list/<company list ID>/item`
    
    It lists all the companies on the authenticated user's selected list, with responses in the following format:
    
        {
            "count": <int>,
            "previous": <url>,
            "next": <url>,
            "results": [
                {
                    "company": {
                        "id": <string>,
                        "archived": <boolean>,
                        "name": <string>,
                        "trading_names": [<string>, <string>, ...]
                    },
                    "created_on": <ISO timestamp>,
                    "latest_interaction": {
                        "id": <string>,
                        "created_on": <ISO timestamp>,
                        "date": <ISO date>,
                        "subject": <string>
                    }
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    
    `latest_interaction` may be `null` if the company has no interactions.
    
    Results are sorted by `latest_interaction.date` in reverse chronological order, with `null` values last.
    
    The endpoint has pagination in line with other endpoints; to retrieve all results pass a large value for the `limit` query parameter (e.g. `?limit=1000`).
    
    If selected list does not exist, the endpoint will return 404 status code.

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `DELETE /v4/company-list/<company list ID>/item/<company ID>`
    
    This removes a company from the user's own selected list of companies.
    
    If the operation is successful, a 204 status code will be returned. If there is no company list with specified company list ID or a list doesn't belong to the user, a 404 will be returned.

  - **OMIS** The following endpoint was added:
    
      - `GET /v4/dataset/omis-dataset`: Present required fields data of all orders to be consumed by data-flow and used in data-workspace for reporting and analyst access.

# Data Hub API 14.4.0 (2019-08-23)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Advisers** The `company_list_companylisttem.adviser_id` column is deprecated and will be removed on or after 2 September 2019.

## Features

  - The `datahub.notification` app was adapted so that it can work with multiple GOVUK notify API keys - so that different apps can define their GOVUK notify templates on different notify service instances.

## Bug fixes

  - **Interactions** Meeting invite ingestion was adjusted so that users do not get error notifications when they send a meeting cancellation.
    
    The notification celery task was modified so that 400/403 level responses do not have automatic retries.

## Internal changes

  - **Advisers** The initial teams fixture (used for tests and new environments) was updated so that only the `DIT_staff` group has permission to use the company lists feature.
  - **Advisers** All legacy company list endpoints now fully operate on a default list for each user. This is in preparation for it being possible for users to have multiple company lists.

## Database schema

  - **Advisers** The `company_list_companylisttem.adviser_id` column was made nullable.

# Data Hub API 14.3.0 (2019-08-22)

## Internal changes

  - **Advisers** A data migration was added to associate all existing company list items with a default list for each user. This is in preparation for it being possible for users to have multiple company lists.
  - Celery was [configured to send task events by default](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#events) (for better compatibility with the Flower monitoring tool).

## Features

  - **Interactions** It is now possible to upload interactions with service answers using the interaction upload tool in the Django admin.

## Internal changes

  - **Advisers** Items added to company lists are now internally associated with a default list for each user. This is in preparation for it being possible for users to have multiple company lists.
  - All remaining uses of the `copy_to` mapping parameter were removed from all Elasticsearch mapping types. All search queries were updated to use corresponding sub-fields instead.

## Database schema

  - **Advisers** A `company_list_companylist` table with the following columns was created:
    
      - `"created_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
      - `"modified_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
      - `"id" uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY`
      - `"name" varchar(255) NOT NULL`

# Data Hub API 14.1.0 (2019-08-15)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** `interaction_interaction`: The deprecated `dit_adviser_id` and `dit_team_id` columns were removed. Please use the `interaction_interactionditparticipant` table instead.

# Data Hub API 14.0.0 (2019-08-12)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** `GET /v3/interaction, GET /v3/interaction/<id>, POST /v3/interaction, PATCH /v3/interaction/<id>`: The deprecated `dit_adviser` and `dit_team` fields were removed from responses. Please use `dit_participants` instead.
  - **Interactions** `interaction_interaction`: The deprecated `dit_adviser_id` and `dit_team_id` columns were prepared for removal and will shortly be removed. Please use the `interaction_interactionditparticipant` table instead.

## Features

  - **Contacts** The search CSV export was updated to handle interactions with multiple teams in the 'Team of latest interaction' column. Multiple team names are separated by commas, and duplicate teams are omitted. The column was accordingly renamed 'Teams of latest interaction'.
  - **Interactions** It's now possible to edit the advisers and teams associated with an interaction from the admin site.
  - It's now possible to configure Gunicorn to [emit monitoring metrics](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/instrumentation.html) to a StatsD host.

## Bug fixes

  - **Interactions** An out-of-memory crash when trying to import a CSV file with blank `contact_email` values was fixed.
    
    (This would only have happened if there were a large number of active contacts in the database with blank email addresses.)

## API

  - **Companies** `POST /v4/dnb/company-search`: This endpoint was modified to ensure that DNB results were hydrated with the corresponding Data Hub company, if it is present and can be matched (by duns number).
    
    The API response returns Data Hub companies alongside DNB data in the following format:
    
        "datahub_company": {
            "id": "0f5216e0-849f-11e6-ae22-56b6b6499611",
            "latest_interaction": {
                "id": "e8c3534f-4f60-4c93-9880-09c22e4fc011",
                "created_on": "2018-04-08T14:00:00Z",
                "date": "2018-06-06",
                "subject": "Exported to Canada"
            }
        }

# Data Hub API 13.14.0 (2019-08-06)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The `service` metadata data model has been changed from a flat list of services to a tree structure with a help of `django-mptt` library.

  - **Interactions** It is now possible to monitor the number of failed and successful calendar invites being ingested in DataHub using StatsD.

  - The API documentation at the URL path `/docs` was updated to use OpenAPI following the upgrade to Django Rest Framework 3.10.0.
    
    It is now enabled by default.
    
    There are currently some missing or incorrect details as we are dependent on the web framework we are using. These should be corrected over time.

## Bug fixes

  - Comma- and semicolon-delimited values in CSV exports are now always sorted alphabetically. (Previously, they were in an unspecified order which could change between exports.)

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** The `metadata_service` table column `name` is deprecated and will be removed on or after the 5th of September 2019.

  -   - **Interactions** The following columns were added to `metadata_service` table to transform flat services list into a tree structure:
        
          - segment (character varying(255)) not null
          - level (integer) not null
          - lft (integer) not null
          - parent\_id (uuid)
          - rght (integer) not null
          - tree\_id (integer) not null
    
    Columns `level`, `lft`, `rght`, `tree_id` are being used by `django-mptt` library to manage the tree structure.
    
    The `parent_id` field points at the parent service.
    
    At present only the leaf nodes are being used as interaction's service foreign keys.

# Data Hub API 13.13.2 (2019-08-05)

## Bug fixes

# Data Hub API 13.13.0 (2019-07-30)

## API

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `GET /v4/user/company-list`

        {
            "count": <int>,
            "previous": <url>,
            "next": <url>,
            "results": [
                {

                        "archived": <boolean>,
                        "name": <string>,
                        "trading_names": [<string>, <string>, ...]
                    },
                    "created_on": <ISO timestamp>,
                    "latest_interaction": {
                        "id": <string>,
                        "created_on": <ISO timestamp>,
                        "date": <ISO date>,
                        "subject": <string>
                    }
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    
    `latest_interaction` may be `null` if the company has no interactions.
    
    Results are sorted by `latest_interaction.date` in reverse chronological order, with `null` values last.
    
    The endpoint has pagination in line with other endpoints; to retrieve all results pass a large value for the `limit` query parameter (e.g. `?limit=1000`).

# Data Hub API 13.12.0 (2019-07-25)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** The `metadata_service.requires_service_answers_flow_feature_flag` column was removed from the database.

## Features

  - **Companies** The admin site company merging tool now updates users' personal company lists if they contain the company being archived.

## API

  - **Advisers** `PUT /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`: A 400 is now returned if an archived company is specified.
    
    In this case, the response body will contain:
    
        {
            "non_field_errors": "An archived company can't be added to a company list."
        }
    
    (Note that it is still possible to remove archived companies from a user's company list.)

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
      - `GET /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
    
    It checks if a company is on the authenticated user's personal list of companies.
    
    If the company is on the user's list, a 2xx status code will be returned. If it is not, a 404 will be returned.

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `DELETE /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
    
    This removes a company from the authenticated user's personal list of companies.
    
    If the operation is successful, a 2xx status code will be returned. If there is no company with the specified company ID, a 404 will be returned.
    
    Currently, the response body is unused.

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** The `metadata_service.requires_service_answers_flow_feature_flag` column was removed from the database.

# Data Hub API 13.11.0 (2019-07-22)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** The `metadata_service.requires_service_answers_flow_feature_flag` column is deprecated will be removed on or after 22 July 2019.

## Features

  - **Interactions** The ability to send received and bounce notifications in case of success and failure of ingesting calendar invite emails respectively has been added to the DataHub.
    
    This is currently behind the `interaction-email-notification` feature flag.

  - **Interactions** The `interaction_service_answers_flow` feature flag was removed and the related functionality is no longer behind a feature flag.

  - An initial endpoint was added for searching for companies through dnb-service (<https://github.com/uktrade/dnb-service/>). This endpoint takes care of auth and proxies requests through to the service - it will return error responses from the proxied DNB service.
    
    There is further work to be done here in terms of iterating features and hardening the implementation.

## Bug fixes

  - **Investment** The schema in the API documentation was corrected for all investment document upload callback endpoints.

## Internal changes

  - Django Rest Framework was updated from version 3.9.4 to version 3.10.1.

# Data Hub API 13.10.0 (2019-07-17)

## Internal changes

  - **Interactions** The context of "Export Opportunities" service has been updated to include export interaction.

## API

  - **Advisers** The following endpoint was added:
    
    `PUT /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
    
    This adds a company to the authenticated user's personal list of companies.
    
    If the operation is successful, a 2xx status code will be returned. If there is no company with the specified company ID, a 404 wil lbe returned.
    
    Currently, the response body is unused.

## Database schema

  - **Advisers** A `company_list_companylistitem` table was created with the following columns:
    
      - `"id" uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY`
      - `"adviser_id" uuid NOT NULL`
      - `"company_id" uuid NOT NULL`
      - `"created_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
      - `"modified_on" timestamp with time zone NULL`
      - `"created_by_id" uuid NULL`
      - `"modified_by_id" uuid NULL`
    
    This table will store a list of companies advisers have added to their personal list of companies.

# Data Hub API 13.9.0 (2019-07-16)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The service names were changed to enable front-end to display them in hierarchy. Services no longer required have been disabled.

## Bug fixes

  - Schemas in the API documentation were corrected for the following endpoints:
      - all archive endpoints
      - all unarchive endpoints
      - the complete OMIS order endpoint
      - the cancel OMIS order endpoint
      - all search endpoints

## Internal changes

  - Python was updated from version 3.7.3 to 3.7.4 in deployed environments.

## API

  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/interaction` now accepts TAP related fields `grant_amount_offered` and `net_company_receipt` for interaction.

  - **Investment** The following endpoints were corrected to return a 404 when a non-existent investment project or proposition was specified:
    
      - `GET,POST /v3/investment/{project_pk}/proposition/{proposition_pk}/document`
      - `GET,DELETE /v3/investment/{project_pk}/proposition/{proposition_pk}/document/{entity_document_pk}`
      - `GET /v3/investment/{project_pk}/proposition/{proposition_pk}/document/{entity_document_pk}/download`
      - `POST /v3/investment/{project_pk}/proposition/{proposition_pk}/document/{entity_document_pk}/upload-callback`
    
    (Previously, they would only return a 404 in some of the possible cases.)

## Database schema

  - An `order double precision` column was added to the `metadata_service` table to store the order of services.

# Data Hub API 13.8.0 (2019-07-10)

## Features

  - The Django Rest Framework built-in documentation was enabled at the URL path `/docs`.
    
    This is currently only enabled if the `ENABLE_API_DOCUMENTATION` environment variable is set to `True` as the documentation is not fully functional as yet.
    
    You must also log into Django admin prior to accessing `/docs`.

  - A new `notification` django app was added for the purpose of sending notifications to Data Hub advisers and contacts. This is a wrapper around the GOVUK Notify service and will be used initially for sending receipt/bounce notifications to advisers who use the meeting invite email ingestion tool.
    
    The app has not yet been added to `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`; this will happen as part of the follow-up work to use the notification app in the meeting invite email ingestion logic.

## Bug fixes

  - An upgrade to sentry-sdk was reverted due to an [observed memory leak](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/419).

# Data Hub API 13.7.0 (2019-07-09)

## Internal changes

  - **Interactions** The meeting email invites ingestion parsing logic was adjusted to use a new `max_interactions` strategy for finding a contact. This ensures that when multiple contacts are found which match the same email address, the contact with the most interactions attributed to it takes precedence. It's an imperfect solution, but acts as a best guess for imperfect data.

## API

  - The activity-stream payload for OMIS and investment projects will now contain `startTime`.

# Data Hub API 13.6.1 (2019-07-08)

## Internal changes

  - The `/whoami/` endpoint was opted out of atomic requests as it does not require them. This change is intended to help reduce the occurence of a race condition that occurs when two requests perform OAuth2 introspection on the same token.

# Data Hub API 13.6.0 (2019-07-02)

## API

  - **Interactions** `GET /v3/interaction`, `GET /v3/interaction/<id>`: A `service_answers` field was added to responses.

  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/interaction`, `PATCH /v3/interaction/<id>`: An optional (depending on selected Service) `service_answers` field was added to request bodies.
    
    The `service_answers` body is expected to be in the following format:
    
        {
            "<service question ID>": {
                "<service answer option ID>": {
                    # body reserved for future use
                }
            },
            ...
        }

  - The activity-stream payload will now contain `dit:team` for all `dit:DataHubAdviser`.

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** A nullable `service_answers jsonb` column was added to the `interaction_interaction` table to store answers to service questions.

# Data Hub API 13.5.0 (2019-06-18)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The Django Admin Interaction Service section has been made read only.

## Internal changes

  - **Events** Events in the test data for acceptance tests were corrected to use a DIT service that is valid for events.

## API

  - **Interactions** `GET /metadata/service/`: The `interaction_questions` field was added to responses. It contains a representation of service questions and answer options from `ServiceQuestion` and `ServiceAnswerOption` models. It is an array of following format:
    
        [ # Array of ServiceQuestion
            {
                'id': <uuid>,
                'name: <str>,
                'disabled_on': <datetime>,
                'answer_options': [ # Array of ServiceAnswerOption
                    {
                        'id': <uuid>,
                        'name': <str>,
                        'disabled_on': <datetime>
                    },
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        ]

  - The activity-stream payload will now contain `dit:jobTitle` for all `dit:DataHubContact`.

  - The activity-stream payload will now contain `url` for all `dit:DataHubContact`.

# Data Hub API 13.4.0 (2019-06-14)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The services in production were replicated to all other environments in preparation for forthcoming changes to interactions and services.

## Bug fixes

  - **OMIS** When a company or a contact name changes, related OMIS orders are now synced to ElasticSearch.

## Internal changes

  - **Interactions** A feature flag with code `interaction_service_answers_flow` was added to control whether services with service questions and answer options are returned by the API.
  - The deprecated Raven Sentry client was replaced with the Sentry SDK.

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** A `metadata_service.requires_service_answers_flow_feature_flag` column was added with type `boolean`. This is used to hide certain services behind a feature flag while related functionality is being built.

# Data Hub API 13.3.0 (2019-06-11)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The admin site import interactions tool is no longer behind a feature flag.

## API

  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/interaction, PATCH /v3/interaction/<id>`: The API now correctly returns an error if `service_delivery` is specified for `kind` when `theme` is `investment`.

  - It is now possible to get a list of OMIS orders added in activity-stream [format.](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)
    
    The URL for this is:
    
    /v3/activity-stream/omis/order-added

# Data Hub API 13.2.0 (2019-06-06)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/interaction, PATCH /v3/interaction/<id>`: The deprecated `dit_adviser` and `dit_team` fields were made read-only in preparation for their removal. Please use `dit_participants` instead.
  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/search/interaction`: The deprecated `dit_adviser` filter was removed. Please use the `dit_participants__adviser` filter instead.
  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/search/interaction`: The deprecated `dit_adviser_name` filter was removed. There is no replacement for this filter.
  - **Interactions** `GET /v3/search`, `POST /v3/search/interaction`: The deprecated `dit_adviser` and `dit_team` interaction fields were removed from interaction objects in responses. Please use `dit_participants` instead.
  - **Interactions** `POST /v3/search/interaction`: The deprecated `dit_team` filter was removed. Please use the `dit_participants__team` filter instead.

## Features

  - **Interactions** The theme field was added to the import interactions admin site tool. The tool is currently behind the `admin-interaction-csv-importer` feature flag as it’s incomplete.

  - **Interactions** A feature was activated for ingesting meeting invite emails sent to a shared mailbox as draft interactions. This enables DIT advisers to create interactions more easily.
    
    This is the first instance of a Data Hub app using the framework provided by the `datahub.email_ingestion` app. There will be subsequent iterations on the `CalendarInteractionEmailProcessor` class to improve the user experience - most notably sending notifications of bounce/receipt to advisers.

## API

  - `GET /v4/activity-feed` now returns an empty list if the authenticated user doesn't have permissions to view all interactions, investment projects or OMIS orders.

  - It is now possible to get a list of investment projects created in activity-stream [format.](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)
    
    The URL for this is:
    
    /v3/activity-stream/investment/project-added

# Data Hub API 13.1.0 (2019-06-03)

## Features

  - **Interactions** The ability to download records that could not be matched to contacts was added to the import interactions admin site tool. The tool is currently behind the `admin-interaction-csv-importer` feature flag as it’s incomplete.

  - **Interactions** The import interactions admin site tool now rejects files that contain duplicate items. The tool is currently behind the `admin-interaction-csv-importer` feature flag as it’s incomplete.

  - **Interactions** The search CSV export was updated to handle interactions with multiple advisers. The previous Adviser and Service provider columns have been merged into a single Advisers column. This column contains the names of all the advisers for each interaction separated by commas. The team of each adviser is in brackets after each name.
    
    For existing interactions, existing teams associated with each interaction have been preserved. For new interactions, the team included is the team each adviser was in when they were added to the interaction.

## Database schema

  - **Interactions** A GIN index for `source` was added to the `interaction_interaction` table.

# Data Hub API 13.0.0 (2019-05-29)

# Data Hub API 11.12.0 (2019-05-02)

## Internal changes

  - The `update_company_registered_address` Django command is now available for internal use. This copies the `registered_address` of all CompaniesHouseCompany records to the corresponding Company record with the same `company_number`. If a CompaniesHouseCompany is not found, it resets the `registered_address`.

## API

  - **Companies** New API endpoints were added to aid matching Data Hub companies with D\&B companies:
    
    All endpoints return a response body with the following format:
    
        {
            "result": {
                ...
            },
            "candidates": [
                { ... },
                { ... }
            ],
            "company": {
                "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
                "name": 'My Corp',
                "trading_names": ["trading name"]
            }
        }
    
    The value of `result` depends on the type of match.
    
    If a match was found and recorded:
    
        {
            "dnb_match": {
                "duns_number": "111",
                'name': 'NAME OF A COMPANY',
                "country": {
                    "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
                    "name": "United States"
                },
                "global_ultimate_duns_number": "112",
                "global_ultimate_name": "NAME OF A GLOBAL COMPANY",
                "global_ultimate_country": {
                    "id": "81756b9a-5d95-e211-a939-e4115bead28a",
                    "name": "United States"
                },
            },
            "matched_by": "data-science"
        },
    
    If `matched_by` contains `adviser` value, then additional `adviser` key will be added to the `result` response:
    
        {
            ...
            "matched_by": "adviser",
            "adviser": {
                "id": "12777b9a-5d95-2241-a939-fa112be2d22a",
                "first_name": "John",
                "last_name": "Doe",
                "name": "John Doe"
            }
        },
    
    If a match wasn't found because the company isn't listed or the adviser is not confident to make the match:
    
        {
            "no_match": {
                "reason': "not_listed",  # or "not_confident"
            },
            "matched_by": "adviser",
            "adviser": { ... }
        },
    
    If a match wasn't found because there were multiple potential matches:
    
        {
            "no_match": {
                "reason": "more_than_one",
                "candidates": [  # list of duns numbers
                    "123456789",
                    "987654321"
                ]
            },
            "matched_by": "adviser",
            "adviser": { ... }
        },
    
    If a match wasn't found because of other reasons:
    
        {
            "no_match": {
                "reason": "other",
                "description": "explanation..."
            },
            "matched_by": "adviser",
            "adviser": { ... }
        },
    
    The top level `candidates` is a list of objects with this format:
    
        {
            "duns_number": 12345,
            "name": 'test name',
            "global_ultimate_duns_number": 12345,
            "global_ultimate_name": "test name global",

# Data Hub API 11.11.0 (2019-04-30)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Companies** On the 4th of May 2019, all data in the `company_company` registered address fields will be replaced by the official data from the Companies House record identified by the `company_company.company_number` field. In cases where `company_company.company_number` is invalid or blank (e.g. for non-UK companies), the registered address fields will be made blank and the related data lost. List of registered address fields:
      - `registered_address_1`
      - `registered_address_2`
      - `registered_address_town`
      - `registered_address_county`
      - `registered_address_postcode`
      - `registered_address_country_id`

## Internal changes

  - **Companies** The field `company.Company.registered_address_country` was made blankable so that it becomes optional in the Django admin.
  - The `company_field_with_copy_to_name_trigram` search field type was removed and uses of it replaced with `company_field`. The `name.keyword`, `name.trigram` and `trading_names.trigram` sub-fields are now used in search queries. This change also means that the type of the `name` sub-field has been corrected from `keyword` to `text`.
  - Python was updated from version 3.7.2 to 3.7.3 in deployed environments.

## Database schema

  - **Companies** The following columns were made `NOT NULL` - optional values will be represented by empty strings:
      - `company_company.registered_address_2`
      - `company_company.registered_address_county`
      - `company_company.registered_address_postcode`
      - `company_company.address_1`

      - `company_company.address_town`
      - `company_company.address_county`
      - `company_company.address_postcode`
      - `company_company.trading_address_1`
      - `company_company.trading_address_2`
      - `company_company.trading_address_town`
      - `company_company.trading_address_county`
      - `company_company.trading_address_postcode`

# Data Hub API 6.2.0 (2018-08-23)

## Deprecations and removals

  - **Companies** The field `account_manager` has been deprecated. Please check the API and Database schema categories for more details.
  - **Companies** The column `company_company.parent_id` has been deleted from the database.
  - `GET /whoami/` endpoint: `read_*` permissions have been renamed to `view_*`. This endpoint will return both `view_*` and `read_*` permissions for now but `read_*` permissions are deprecated and will soon be removed.

## Features

  - **Companies** It's now possible to export the one list via the django admin from the company changelist.
  - **Interactions** The CSV export of search results has been amended to return various additional columns.
  - **Investment** It's now possible to export investment project search results as a CSV file (up to a maximum of 5000 results).
  - The format of timestamps in CSV exports and reports was changed to YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS for better compatibility with Microsoft Excel.
  - Document upload now uses V2 API of AV service.

## Bug fixes

  - Document upload streaming to AV service now uses a StreamWrapper to encode the file as multipart/form-data in order to send it to AV service. This fixes the problem when the file has been sent incorrectly.

## Internal changes

  - Django was updated to version 2.1.
