# Introduction

The Department of International Trade provides information to the Cabinet Office for capturing business intelligence around interactions through CSV file exports.  The CSV file is then manually altered to service the requirements and formats needed by the BED system and store interactions in a slightly different format needing reconciliation on a quarterly basis for generating reports needed by the Cabinet Office. 

Both systems expose APIâ€™s that facilitate REST CRUD operations, therefore with the utilisation of Cellery, this data synchronisation could occur as a short based or long based operation, depending on the volume of data, done on a daily basis.

# BED system basics

This is to help with basic site familiarisation of the BED system. 

1. Get invited or setup by an Administrator of BED.
2. Login and navigate to [reset the security token](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/settings/personal/ResetApiToken/home) where you can generate a session id.
3. In conjunction with your email and password, can facilitate the BED environment settings explained in the environment variable configuration.
4. The [home sandbox](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home) help orient all the pages and content related to BED organization and interactions
5. Datahub Companies are known as BED [Accounts](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Account/list?filterName=Recent).
6. Datahub Contacts are BED [Contacts](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Contact/list?filterName=Recent).
7. Datahub Interactions are BED [Events or Add Interactions](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Event__c/list?filterName=Recent).
8. BED data structures and mapping information can be found within the [Object Manager](https://loginhub--november.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/ObjectManager/home).
