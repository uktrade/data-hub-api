A new `full_telephone_number` field has been added that combines the area code and phone number into a single field.

The old area code and phone number fields are now deprecated.

The full_telephone_number field is available on the `v3/contact` and `v4/contact` API endpoints. The deprecated fields will remain available until API consumers have been updated.
