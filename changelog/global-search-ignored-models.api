``GET /v3/search``: ``companieshousecompany`` is now correctly not accepted in the ``entity`` parameter, and not included in the returned ``aggregations`` array. (Previously, specifying ``companieshousecompany`` in the ``entity`` parameter caused all search models to be searched.) If you want to search Companies House companies, please use ``/v3/search/companieshousecompany`` instead.
