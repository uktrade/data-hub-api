To allow the investment verification team to move projects between stages in the front end, rather than in Django Admin, a new endpoint `v3/investment/<uuid:pk>/update-stage` accepts post requests from users with new permission `change_to_any_stage_investmentproject` to change a project between any of the five stages. The status of the project is also updated if moving from or to the 'won' stage.
