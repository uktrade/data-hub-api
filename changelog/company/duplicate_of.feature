New fields named ``transferred_to`` and ``transfer_reason`` have been added to indicate if a company has had its data
transferred to another record and should no longer be used. The field contains a reference to the company that should
be used instead. The field cannot be directly changed; it will be set by an upcoming admin tool for merging duplicate
companies.
