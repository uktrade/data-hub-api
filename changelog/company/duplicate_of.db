A new nullable column ``transferred_to`` has been added to the ``company_company`` table as a foreign key to another company
record. The column indicates that data about the company has been transferred to another record, and the referenced
company is the one that should be used instead.

A new column ``transfer_reason`` has been added to the ``company_company`` table. This indicates the reason that data
about the company was transferred. The current possible values are an empty string, or ``'duplicate'``.
