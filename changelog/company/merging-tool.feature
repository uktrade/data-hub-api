A tool for merging duplicate companies was added to the admin site. This tool moves contacts and interactions from one
company to another, and archives the company that the contacts and interactions were moved from. The tool is
accessed via a link displayed when viewing a single company (in the admin site). Some limitations exist (for example,
companies with investment projects or OMIS orders cannot be merged into another company).
