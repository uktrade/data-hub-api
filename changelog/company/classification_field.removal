The column ``company_company.classification_id`` is deprecated and will be deleted on or after December, 13. Please use ``company_company.one_list_tier_id`` with foreign keys to ``company_onelisttier`` instead of ``metadata_companyclassification``. The IDs were preserved so the records in the ``company_onelisttier`` table match the records in the deprecated ``metadata_companyclassification``.
