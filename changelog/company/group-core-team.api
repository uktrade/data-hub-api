The Core Team endpoint was changed:

``GET /company/<id>/core-team`` was renamed to ``GET /company/<id>/onelist-group-core-team``. The old ``/core-team`` endpoint still exists but will be completely removed on or after November, 29.

``GET /company/<id>/onelist-group-core-team`` now returns the Core Team for the group that the company is part of. All companies in the group inherit that team from their Global Headquarters.
