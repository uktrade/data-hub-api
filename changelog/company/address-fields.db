The following fields where added:

``"address_1" varchar(255)``

``"address_2" varchar(255)``

``"address_country_id" uuid``

``"address_county" varchar(255)``

``"address_postcode" varchar(255)``

``"address_town" varchar(255)``

The system will be migrated from using the ``registered_address_*`` and ``trading_address_*`` fields to ``address_*`` (main location for the business) and ``registered_address_*`` (official address) fields instead.
However, you should not use the new address fields yet and migration steps will be communicated in future release notes.
