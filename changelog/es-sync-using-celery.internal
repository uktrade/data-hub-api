Updates to records are now synced to Elasticsearch using Celery (rather than the thread pool). This will improve
performance when many records are updated at once, and increase reliability as failed synchronisation attempts are
automatically retried. This means that Redis and Celery must be configured and running to use endpoints that create
or update records.
