A setting to sync updates to records to Elasticsearch using Celery (rather than the thread pool) was adding. This
will improve performance when many records are updated at once, and increase reliability as failed synchronisation
attempts are automatically retried. When the setting is enabled, Redis and Celery must be configured and running to
use endpoints that create or update records.
