The following new Hawk endpoints have been added:

`POST /v3/public/omis/order/<public-token>/payment-gateway-session`
`GET /v3/public/omis/order/<public-token>/payment-gateway-session/<session-id>` 

The new endpoints are functionally the same as their following counterparts:

`POST /v3/omis/public/order/<public-token>/payment-gateway-session`
`GET /v3/omis/public/order/<public-token>/payment-gateway-session/<session-id>`
