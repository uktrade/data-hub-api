A new Hawk authenticated `GET /v3/public/omis/order/<public-token>/quote` and 
`POST /v3/public/omis/order/<public-token>/quote/accept` endpoints have been added.
The new endpoints are functionally the same as `GET /v3/omis/public/order/<public-token>/quote` 
and `POST /v3/omis/public/order/<public-token>/invoice/accept`.
