The new SSO authentication logic is now enabled by default.

This means that, when logging into Data Hub, users are now identified using their unique SSO email user ID instead of their primary email address.

'OAuth token introspection' events are now logged on the User events page in the admin site whenever Data Hub API checks in with Staff SSO to get details about a userâ€™s access token.
