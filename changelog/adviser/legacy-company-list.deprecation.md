The following legacy company list endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 6 November 2019:

- `GET /v4/user/company-list`
- `GET /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
- `PUT /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`
- `DELETE /v4/user/company-list/<company ID>`

Please use the new multi-list endpoints starting with `/v4/company-list` instead.
