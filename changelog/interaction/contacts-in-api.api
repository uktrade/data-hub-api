``GET,POST /v3/interaction``, ``GET,PATCH /v3/interaction/<id>``: ``contacts`` was added as an array field to replace the ``contact`` field.
The ``contact`` and ``contacts`` field will mirror each other (except that ``contact`` will only return a single contact). The ``contact``
field is deprecated and will be removed on or after 21 February 2019.
