``GET /v3/interaction``: ``first_name_of_first_contact`` and ``last_name_of_first_contact`` were added as ``sortby``
query parameter values for sorting event service deliveries by the first or last name of the contact. These sorting
options aren't intended to be used for other types of interaction which may have multiple contacts.

The ``contact__first_name`` and ``contact__last_name`` sorting options are deprecated and will be removed on or after
28 February 2019.
