The Django Rest Framework built-in documentation was enabled at the URL path ``/docs``.

This is currently only enabled if the ``ENABLE_API_DOCUMENTATION`` environment variable is
set to ``True`` as the documentation is not fully functional as yet.

You must also log into Django admin prior to accessing ``/docs``.
