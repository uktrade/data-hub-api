Leeloo provides an API into Data Hub for Data Hub clients. Using Leeloo you can search for entities and manage companies, contacts and interactions.

More guides can be found in the [docs](./docs/) folder.

## Installation with Docker

Leeloo uses Docker compose to setup and run all the necessary components. The docker-compose.yml file provided is meant to be used for running tests and development.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo
    cd data-hub-leeloo
    ```

2.  Create a `.env` file from `sample.env`

    ```shell
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

3.  Build and run the necessary containers for the required environment:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

    * It will take time for the leeloo API container to come up - it will run
      migrations on both DBs, load initial data, sync elasticsearch etc. Watch
      along in the api container's logs.
    * **NOTE:**
      If you are using a linux system, the elasticsearch container may not
      come up successfully (`data-hub-leeloo_es_1`) - it might be perpetually
      restarting.
      If the logs for that container mention something like
      `max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]`,
      you will need to run the following on your host machine:

      ```shell
      sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
      ```

      and append/modify the `vm.max_map_count` setting in `/etc/sysctl.conf` (so
      that this setting persists after restart):

      ```shell
      vm.max_map_count=262144
      ```

      For more information, [see the elasticsearch docs on vm.max_map_count](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/vm-max-map-count.html).

4.  Optionally, you may want to run a local copy of the data hub frontend.
    By default, you can run both leeloo and the frontend under one docker-compose
    project.  [See the instructions in the frontend readme to set it up](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend/#setting-up-with-docker-compose).

## Native installation (without Docker)

Dependencies:

-   Python 3.7.x
-   PostgreSQL 10 (note: PostgreSQL 9.6 is used for the MI database)
-   redis 3.2
-   Elasticsearch 6.7

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo
    cd data-hub-leeloo
    ```

2.  Install Python 3.7.

    [See this guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/) for detailed instructions for different platforms.

3.  Install system dependencies:

    On Ubuntu:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install build-essential libpq-dev python3.7-dev python3.7-venv
    ```

    On macOS:

    ```shell
    brew install libpq
    ```

4.  Create and activate the virtualenv:

    ```shell
    python3.7 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    ```

5.  Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  Create an `.env` settings file (itâ€™s gitignored by default):

    ```shell
    cp config/settings/sample.env config/settings/.env
    ```

7.  Set `DOCKER_DEV=False` in `.env`
8.  Create the db. By default, the dev version uses postgres:

    ```shell
    psql -p5432
    create database datahub;
    ```

9. Make sure you have Elasticsearch running locally. If you don't, you can run one in Docker:

    ```shell
    docker run -p 9200:9200 -e "http.host=0.0.0.0" -e "transport.host=127.0.0.1" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2
    ```

10. Make sure you have redis running locally and that the REDIS_BASE_URL in your `.env` is up-to-date.

11. Populate the database and initialise Elasticsearch:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py init_es

    ./manage.py loadinitialmetadata
    ./manage.py createinitialrevisions
    ```

12. Optionally, you can load some test data and update Elasticsearch:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py loaddata fixtures/test_data.yaml

    ./manage.py sync_es --foreground
    ```

13. Create a superuser:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

14. Start the server:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py runserver
    ```

15. Start celery:

    ```shell
    celery worker -A config -l info -Q celery,long-running -B
    ```

    Note that in production the long-running queue is run in a separate worker with the
    `-O fair --prefetch-multiplier 1` arguments for better fairness when long-running tasks
    are running or pending execution.

## API documentation

Automatically-generated API documentation is served at `/docs` (requires admin site credentials). 

## Local development

If using Docker, prefix these commands with `docker-compose run leeloo`.

To run the tests:

```shell
./tests.sh
```

To run the tests in parallel, pass `-n <number of processes>` to `./tests.sh`. For example, for four processes:


```shell
./tests.sh -n 4
```


To run the linter:

```shell
flake8
```

## Granting access to the front end

The [internal front end](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend) uses single sign-on. You should configure Leeloo as follows to use with the front end:

* `SSO_ENABLED`: `True`
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_URL`: URL of the [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) introspection endpoint (should be the same server the front end is using). This is provided by a [Staff SSO](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) instance.
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`: Access token for the introspection server.

The token should have the `data-hub:internal-front-end` scope. django-oauth-toolkit will create a user corresponding to the token if one does not already exist.

## Granting access to machine-to-machine clients

To give access to a machine-to-machine client that doesn't require user authentication:

1. Log into the [Django admin applications page](http://localhost:8000/admin/oauth2_provider/application/) and add a new OAuth application with these details:

    * Client type: Confidential
    * Authorization grant type: Client credentials

1. Define the required scopes for the app by adding a new record in the
[OAuth application scopes](http://localhost:8000/admin/oauth/oauthapplicationscope/)
page with these details:
    * Application: The application just created
    * Scope: The required scopes

The currently defined scopes can be found in [`datahub/oauth/scopes.py`](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-leeloo/tree/develop/datahub/oauth/scopes.py).

[Further information about the available grant types can be found in the OAuthLib docs](http://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/oauth2/grants/grants.html).

## Management commands

If using Docker, remember to run these commands inside your container by prefixing them with `docker-compose run leeloo`.

### Database


#### Apply migrations

```shell
./manage.py migrate
```

#### Create django-reversion initial revisions

If the database is freshly built or a new versioned model is added run:

```shell
./manage.py createinitialrevisions
```

#### Load initial metadata

These commands are generally only intended to be used on a blank database.

```shell
./manage.py loadinitialmetadata
```


### Elasticsearch

Create the Elasticsearch index (if it doesn't exist) and update the mapping:

```shell
./manage.py init_es
```

Resync all Elasticsearch records (using Celery):

```shell
./manage.py sync_es
```

Resync all Elasticsearch records synchronously (without Celery running):

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --foreground
```

You can resync only specific models by using the `--model=` argument.

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --model=company --model=contact
```

For more details including all the available choices:

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --help
```

Migrate modified mappings:

```shell
./manage.py migrate_es
```

Elasticsearch mapping migrations are fairly complex â€“ see [docs/Elasticsearch migrations.md](docs/Elasticsearch&#32;migrations.md) for more detail.


### Companies House

Update Companies House records:

```shell
./manage.py sync_ch
```

This downloads the latest data from Companies House, updates the Companies House table and triggers an Elasticsearch sync.

(Note that this does not remove any records from the Companies House table.)

## Dependencies

See [Managing dependencies](docs/Managing&#32;dependencies.md) for information about installing,
adding and upgrading dependencies.

## Activity Stream

The `/v3/activity-stream/*` endpoints are protected by two mechanisms:

* IP address whitelisting via the `X-Forwarded-For` header, with a comma separated list of whitelisted IPs in the environment variable `PAAS_IP_WHITELIST`.

* Hawk authentication via the `Authorization` header, with the credentials in the environment variables `ACTIVITY_STREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACTIVITY_STREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.


### IP address whitelisting

The authentication blocks requests that do not have a whitelisted IP in the second-from-the-end IP in `X-Forwarded-For` header. In general, this cannot be trusted. However, in PaaS, this can be, and this is the only production environment. Ideally, this would be done at a lower level than HTTP, but this is not possible with the current architecture.

If making requests to this endpoint locally, you must manually add this header or disable the check using `DISABLE_PAAS_IP_CHECK` environment variable.


### Hawk authentication

In general, Hawk authentication hashing the HTTP payload and `Content-Type` header, and using a nonce, are both _optional_. Here, as with the Activity Stream endpoints in other DIT projects, both are _required_. `Content-Type` may be the empty string, and if there is no payload, then it should be treated as the empty string.
