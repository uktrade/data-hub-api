Data Hub API provides an API into Data Hub for Data Hub clients. Using Data Hub API you can search for entities and manage companies, contacts and interactions.

More guides can be found in the [docs](./docs/) folder.

## Installation with Docker

This project uses Docker compose to setup and run all the necessary components. The docker-compose.yml file provided is meant to be used for running tests and development.

**Note for Mac Users:** By default, docker on Mac will restrict itself to using just 2GB of memory. This [should be increased](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) to at least 4GB to avoid running in to unexpected problems.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-api
    cd data-hub-api
    ```

2.  Create `.env` files from `sample.env`

    ```shell
    cp sample.env .env
    cp config/settings/sample.env config/settings/.env
    ```

    If you're working with data-hub-frontend and mock-sso, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_SSO_EMAIL_USER_ID`
    should be the same as MOCK_SSO_EMAIL_USER_ID in mock-sso’s .env file.

3.  Build and run the necessary containers for the required environment:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```

    * It will take time for the API container to come up - it will run
      migrations on both DBs, load initial data, sync elasticsearch etc. Watch
      along in the api container's logs.
    * **NOTE:**
      If you are using a linux system, the elasticsearch container may not
      come up successfully (`data-hub-api_es_1`) - it might be perpetually
      restarting.
      If the logs for that container mention something like
      `max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]`,
      you will need to run the following on your host machine:

      ```shell
      sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
      ```

      and append/modify the `vm.max_map_count` setting in `/etc/sysctl.conf` (so
      that this setting persists after restart):

      ```shell
      vm.max_map_count=262144
      ```

      For more information, [see the elasticsearch docs on vm.max_map_count](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.6/vm-max-map-count.html).

4.  Optionally, you may want to run a local copy of the data hub frontend.
    By default, you can run both the API and the frontend under one docker-compose
    project.  [See the instructions in the frontend readme to set it up](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend/#running-project-within-docker).

## Native installation (without Docker)

Dependencies:

-   Python 3.8.x
-   PostgreSQL 10 (note: PostgreSQL 9.6 is used for the MI database)
-   redis 3.2
-   Elasticsearch 6.8

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-api
    cd data-hub-api
    ```

2.  Install Python 3.8.

    [See this guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/) for detailed instructions for different platforms.

3.  Install system dependencies:

    On Ubuntu:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install build-essential libpq-dev python3.8-dev python3.8-venv
    ```

    On macOS:

    ```shell
    brew install libpq
    ```

4.  Create and activate the virtualenv:

    ```shell
    python3.8 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    ```

5.  Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  Create an `.env` settings file (it’s gitignored by default):

    ```shell
    cp config/settings/sample.env config/settings/.env
    ```

7.  Set `DOCKER_DEV=False` in `.env`
8.  Create the required PostgreSQL databases:

    ```shell
    psql -p5432
    create database datahub;
    create database mi;
    ```

    (Most Django apps use the `datahub` database. The `mi` database is used only by the `mi_dashboard` Django app.)

9. Make sure you have Elasticsearch running locally. If you don't, you can run one in Docker:

    ```shell
    docker run -p 9200:9200 -e "http.host=0.0.0.0" -e "transport.host=127.0.0.1" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.8.2
    ```

10. Make sure you have redis running locally and that the REDIS_BASE_URL in your `.env` is up-to-date.

11. Populate the databases and initialise Elasticsearch:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py migrate --database mi
    ./manage.py migrate_es

    ./manage.py loadinitialmetadata
    ./manage.py createinitialrevisions
    ```

12. Optionally, you can load some test data:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py loaddata fixtures/test_data.yaml
    ```

    Note that this will queue Celery tasks to index the created records in Elasticsearch,
    and hence the loaded records won‘t be returned by search endpoints until Celery is
    started and the queued tasks have run.

13. Create a superuser:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    (You can enter any valid email address as the username and SSO email user ID.)

14. Start the server:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py runserver
    ```

15. Start celery:

    ```shell
    celery worker -A config -l info -Q celery,long-running -B
    ```

    Note that in production the long-running queue is run in a separate worker with the
    `-O fair --prefetch-multiplier 1` arguments for better fairness when long-running tasks
    are running or pending execution.

## API documentation

Automatically-generated API documentation is served at `/docs` (requires admin site credentials).

## Local development

If using Docker, prefix these commands with `docker-compose run api`.

To run the tests:

```shell
./tests.sh
```

To run the tests in parallel, pass `-n <number of processes>` to `./tests.sh`. For example, for four processes:


```shell
./tests.sh -n 4
```

By default all tests are executed. To skip tests that should not run under certain conditions ie. are dependent on external services, use a marker `excluded` or a marker that start with `excluded_`. 

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.excluded
class TestClass:
    def test_1(self):
        ...

@pytest.mark.excluded
def test_1():
    ...

@pytest.mark.excluded_dependent_on_redis
def test_2():
    ...
```

To exclude such tests from running use one of the options below:

```shell
pytest --skip-excluded
pytest -m excluded_dependent_on_redis
pytest -m "excluded_x or excluded_y"
pytest -m "not (excluded_x or excluded_y)"
```
**NOTE:** When testing, using the `--reuse-db` can speed up test runs by excluding migrations

To run the linter:

```shell
flake8
```

There is also a pre-commit hook for Flake8. To install this, run:

```shell
make setup-flake8-hook
```

### Obtaining an API access token

You can obtain an access token for local development work in one of two ways:

- by running `./manage.py add_access_token <SSO email user ID>` with the SSO
  email user ID of an existing adviser (run 
  `./manage.py add_access_token --help` for a list of options)
- using the form on `http://localhost:8000/admin/add-access-token/`

(If you’re using Docker, an access token will be created automatically if 
certain environment variables are set. See `sample.env` for more details.)

This access token can be used with most endpoints by setting an 
`Authorization` header value of `Bearer <access token>`. 

Note that machine-to-machine endpoints (such as those under `/v4/metadata/`) 
instead use Hawk authentication and request signing.

## Granting access to the front end

The [internal front end](https://github.com/uktrade/data-hub-frontend) uses single sign-on. You should configure the API as follows to use with the front end:

* `SSO_ENABLED`: `True`
* `STAFF_SSO_BASE_URL`: URL of a [Staff SSO](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) or [Mock SSO](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso) instance. This should be the same server the front end is configured to use.
* `STAFF_SSO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Access token for Staff SSO.

## Granting access to machine-to-machine clients

Pure machine-to-machine clients use Hawk authentication with separate credentials for each client.

There are separate views for such clients as these views don’t expect `request.user` to be set.

Hawk credentials for each client are defined in settings below and each client is assigned scopes in `config/settings/common.py`.

These scopes define which views each client can access.

## Management commands

If using Docker, remember to run these commands inside your container by prefixing them with `docker-compose run api`.

### Database


#### Apply migrations

##### For the default database

```shell
./manage.py migrate
```

##### For the MI database

```shell
./manage.py migrate --database mi
```

#### Create django-reversion initial revisions

If the database is freshly built or a new versioned model is added run:

```shell
./manage.py createinitialrevisions
```

#### Load initial metadata

These commands are generally only intended to be used on a blank database.

```shell
./manage.py loadinitialmetadata
```


### Elasticsearch

#### Update indexes and mapping types

To create missing Elasticsearch indexes and migrate modified mapping types:

```shell
./manage.py migrate_es
```

This will also resync data (using Celery) for any newly-created indexes.

See [docs/Elasticsearch migrations.md](docs/Elasticsearch&#32;migrations.md) for more detail about how the command works.

#### Resync all Elasticsearch records

To resync all records using Celery:

```shell
./manage.py sync_es
```

To resync all records synchronously (without Celery running):

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --foreground
```

You can resync only specific models by using the `--model=` argument.

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --model=company --model=contact
```

For more details including all the available choices:

```shell
./manage.py sync_es --help
```

## Dependencies

See [Managing dependencies](docs/Managing&#32;dependencies.md) for information about installing,
adding and upgrading dependencies.

## Activity Stream

The `/v3/activity-stream/*` endpoints are protected by two mechanisms:

* IP address whitelisting via the `X-Forwarded-For` header, with a comma separated list of whitelisted IPs in the environment variable `PAAS_IP_WHITELIST`.

* Hawk authentication via the `Authorization` header, with the credentials in the environment variables `ACTIVITY_STREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACTIVITY_STREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.


### IP address whitelisting

The authentication blocks requests that do not have a whitelisted IP in the second-from-the-end IP in `X-Forwarded-For` header. In general, this cannot be trusted. However, in PaaS, this can be, and this is the only production environment. Ideally, this would be done at a lower level than HTTP, but this is not possible with the current architecture.

If making requests to this endpoint locally, you must manually add this header or disable the check using `DISABLE_PAAS_IP_CHECK` environment variable.


### Hawk authentication

In general, Hawk authentication hashing the HTTP payload and `Content-Type` header, and using a nonce, are both _optional_. Here, as with the Activity Stream endpoints in other DIT projects, both are _required_. `Content-Type` may be the empty string, and if there is no payload, then it should be treated as the empty string.
